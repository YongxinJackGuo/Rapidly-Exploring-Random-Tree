# Rapidly-exploring Random Tree(RRT) Path Search and Planning  

Robotic arm path planning using RRT algorithm in MATLAB  
-detectCollision: detect if a line segments interfere with the box objects  
-getFK: get the forward kinematics expression using joint angle input to get the end pose in cartesian coordinates  
-isRobotCollided: collision detection by discretizing the robotic arm into a set of cylinders made up with surface line segments  
-robot.mat: robotic arm configuration data  
-rrt.m: RRT algorithm implementation  
-runsim: run simulation  
-utils: some utilty codes
